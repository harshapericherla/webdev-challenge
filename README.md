## Project Setup

PHP version - 7.2.26 or above <br/>
Database - MySql Server <br/>
Install composer and run "composer install" command from cmd in the project directory to install all the dependencies. <br/>
<br/>
- Create .env file after pulling project from git <br/>
- Configure the database in .env, take .env.example as example which you can find in the project directory <br/>
- Execute command php artisan key:generate to generate the application key <br/>

## Implementation

I believe that a developer is someone who is language agnostic, he/she should have strong fundamentals on the concepts and rest of the  <br/>
things can be implemented whatever language it might be. I have not coded in PHP before, this is the first time ever I have learned and <br/>
written PHP code by using a MVC framework laravel. I am proud of what I have accomplished, in a few days I picked up a new language and <br/>
a framework and written code using it. I believe that I can do the same when in professional envinorment as well, pick up new things and implement <br/>
them without delay, and that's what companies want right!!! developers who are enthusiastic and love to be challenged. I am one of them. <br/>
